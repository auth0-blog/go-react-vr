# Authentication in Golang with JWTs

![Auth0 Go React](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/go-auth/go-react-app-final.png)

This application will show you how to build and secure a mock voting application. You'll create an API with Go and a frontend with React that will consume your API. You'll secure your API using Auth0 so that only authenticated users can access and vote on products.

[Authentication in Golang with JWTs](https://auth0.com/blog/authentication-in-golang)

## Technology

This demo uses:

- [Go v1.14](https://golang.org/)
- [React v16.13](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

Make sure you have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) before running the demo.

## Running the demo

**Clone and get dependencies**

* Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/auth0-blog/go-react-vr-auth`
* Switch to the directory that holds the repo `cd go-react-vr-auth`
* Run `go get` to grab the dependencies

**Auth0 Setup**

If you do not have an Auth0 account, [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for one now.

* Navigate to the Auth0 [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and click on **Create Application**. Name your application anything you'd like, select "Single Page Web Applications", and click **Create**.
* Click on **Settings** and fill in **Allowed Callback URLs**, **Allowed Logout URLs**, and **Allowed Web Origins** with `http://localhost:3000` and then press **Save changes**.
* Back in your code, create a new file to store some of these variables:

```bash
touch static/src/auth_config.json
```

Then fill it in with:

```json
{
  "domain": "YOUR_DOMAIN",
  "clientId": "YOUR_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID",
  "audience": "YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER"
}
```

Update this with your own credentials. You can find them in your Auth0 dashboard application page that you just created.

* Now set up the Go API with Auth0. In the dashboard, click on **APIs** in the sidebar and then click **Create API**.
* Give it any name you'd like. For identifier, this can be anything, but for naming conventions we recommend a URL format (doesn't have to be a real URL). Leave Signing Algorithm as is and click **Create**.
* Update your `main.go` file with the required values from the Auth0 dashboard. There are 3 different spots that need to be updated:

```go
// main.go
// ...
aud := "YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER"
// ...
iss := "https://YOUR_DOMAIN/"
// ...  
resp, err := http.Get("https://YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json")
// ...
```

Your **Identifier** is listed on the Settings tab of the API you just created in the dashboard. To find `YOUR_DOMAIN`, click on the **Quick Start** tab and scroll down to the code snippet. Copy the value for `options.Authority` and use that to replace `YOUR_DOMAIN`. Make sure you keep the trailing slash for `iss` in `main.go`.

**Run React**

* Open a new terminal tab and switch to the React directory and then pull in the required dependencies

```bash
cd static
npm install
```

* Start your React application

```bash
npm start
```

**Run Go**

* In a separate terminal tab, grab the dependencies

```bash
go get
```

* Build and run your Go application:

```bash
go run .
```
